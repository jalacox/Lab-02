  <h1>Welcome to Jala's World!</h1>
  <p>Hello 👋🏾 , here you will learn a little bit about me!
    <sub> might be tested on things about me too. so read and look caerfully!</sub> and enjoy! 🫶🏾 
  </p>
  <p>My name is Jala Cox and I was born and raised in Memphis,TN. My parents birth me on October 2, 1998, so you do the math. I have a passion for Art and Music, it’s something I’ve always had interest in growing up. Within my Passion I’ve dibbled and dabbled in a little bit of everything from Visual, Digital, Musical and Creative arts. After Graduating high school it was hard for me to choose a career path that I really enjoyed. I attended Memphis College of Art and took up graphic design and visual arts. Due to them closing down I took a stab at Southwest Tennessee Community College majoring in Computer Science. After that didn’t work out how I wanted I ran across Code Crew and now I’m an upcoming Software Developer/Coder at Code Crew. My main goal this go round is to use coding within my personal business being an Entrepreneur, and also land my position at Google as a Senior Computational Designer. </p>
